# Embeddings
Embeddings API lets you turn some input text (the input) into an array of numbers (the embedding). The resulting embedding can be compared against other embeddings to determine how closely related the two input strings are.

Embeddings from large datasets can be stored in vector databases for later retrieval or comparison. Common use cases for embeddings are search, classification, and recommendations. They're also used for building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.
